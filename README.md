This project highlights integration of a cloud development workflow with GitHub Codespaces, Expo, and React Native to develop mobile apps in an efficient way. The assignment stresses building a minimalistic user interface with strict limitation of components to a single View, three Text, and a single StyleSheet. It promotes compact and clean code designing. With Expo, developers skip cumbersome native setup, with easier previewing of apps in real time via Expo Go app. GitHub Codespaces offers additional convenience with a zero-install cloud IDE, in line with contemporary practice of remote, scalable development. Instant testing of UI changes through hot reloading immensely increases productivity. This exercise also reinforces underpinning knowledge of component-based design, styling with Flexbox, and strength of React Native in declarative programming. Overall, the project reinforces knowledge of full-stack mobile app development through practical application of core tools and cloud-based technology.
